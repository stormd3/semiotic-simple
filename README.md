Started out with the
[release version 1.1.4](https://github.com/emeeks/semiotic/releases/tag/v1.1.4)
of semiotic.

Then add in the examples from
[semiotic-examples](https://github.com/stormasm/semiotic-examples-114)
with the examples pushed down one level.

Then modify the examples to point to the source code instead
of the npm semiotic package.

This enables one to debug into the code with the simpler examples.
